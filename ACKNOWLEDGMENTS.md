## Sroeurnsuon

A special thanks to Sroeurnsuon for providing the additional modifications in a fork of Bill Barry's original pyqwc
project. His work provided a great example of the workflow involved with the QBWC application which allowed me to move
quickly on producing a modernized implementation.
